I decided I wanted to \r\n            understand them better, which led me to embark on my Master's education in the following years. This implied taking \r\n            a few evening classes for general engineering courses at a local community college while working (!) so I could start building a solid technical base. When I returned to Madrid I continued this preparatory stage at the 'Universidad Poltécnica de Madrid'\r\n            to ensure I could be successful in getting my Master's degree.`,\r\n            `While at this position, in the field, I would help diagnose technical issues in our installations, such as a faulty \r\n            inverter. At the office, I learned about our day-to-day tasks and business flows, and I imagined these could be \r\n            optimized. So I began playing around with Excel macros (VBA) and simple JavaScript in PDFs to automatically generate \r\n            proposals, electric utility interconnection applications, and anything I could get my hands on. Back then I wasn't \r\n            aware of the booming RPA industry so nowadays I hope to apply Python and JS scripts to my tasks, as well as a proper \r\n            RPA suite like UiPath or BluePrism.`\r\n        ],\t\t           \r\n        slides: [\r\n            {\r\n                src: 'solar/coolAndCasual.jpg',\r\n                description: 'At the office, with less hair than now'\r\n            },\r\n            {\r\n                src: 'solar/withMayor.jpg',\r\n                description: 'Municipal award for most solar installations with the Mayor of Washington, DC'\r\n            },\r\n            {\r\n                src: 'solar/onRoof.jpg',\r\n                description: 'At one of our commercial-scale installations with some coworkers and crew members'\r\n            },\r\n        ],\r\n    },\r\n    rpa: {\r\n        title: 'Robotic Process Automation (RPA)',\r\n        source: '../static/images/rpa/diploma0.jpg',\r\n        paragraphs: [\r\n            ``       \r\n        ],\r\n        slides: [\r\n\r\n        ],\r\n    },\r\n    bollos: {\r\n        title: 'Industrial Automation',\r\n        source: '../static/images/bollos/wincc.jpg',\r\n        paragraphs: [\r\n            ``       \r\n        ],\r\n        slides: [\r\n\r\n        ],\r\n    },\r\n    dobot: {\r\n        title: \"Master's Internship\",\r\n        source: '../static/images/dobot/dobot0.jpg',\r\n        paragraphs: [\r\n            ``       \r\n        ],\r\n        slides: [\r\n\r\n        ],\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport const experiences = {\r\n    masters : {\r\n        id: 'masters',\r\n        position: \"Master's Degree in Electromechanical Engineering\",\r\n        date: 'February 2019',\r\n        organization: 'ETS Ingeniería y Diseño Industrial, Universidad Politécnica de Madrid',\r\n        location: 'Madrid, Spain',\r\n        bullets: [\r\n            \"Master's Thesis -
